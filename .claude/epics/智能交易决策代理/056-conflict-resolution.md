# Task: 005-conflict-resolution - Conflict Detection and Resolution Mechanism

## Overview
Implement intelligent conflict detection and resolution mechanisms that identify contradictions between bullish and bearish trading strategies, analyze the root causes of conflicts, and apply appropriate resolution strategies to generate optimal trading decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria

  - Signal direction conflicts (bullish vs bearish)
  - Timing conflicts (different entry/exit points)
  - Position sizing conflicts (different risk approaches)
  - Indicator interpretation conflicts
  - Market condition assessment conflicts

- [ ] **Conflict Severity Assessment**: Comprehensive conflict evaluation including:
  - Conflict intensity scoring (low, medium, high, critical)
  - Impact analysis on trading decisions
  - Probability estimation of correct resolution
  - Risk assessment of each conflicting view
  - Confidence level calibration

- [ ] **Root Cause Analysis**: Intelligent conflict source identification including:
  - Data source conflicts
  - Analytical method conflicts

## Technical Implementation Details

### Conflict Detection Engine

#### Conflict Detection Framework
```typescript
// Conflict detection system
class ConflictDetectionEngine {
  private conflictAnalyzers: ConflictAnalyzer[];
  private severityCalculator: SeverityCalculator;
  private patternRecognizer: ConflictPatternRecognizer;

  async detectConflicts(
    bullishStrategy: TradingStrategy,
    bearishStrategy: TradingStrategy,
    marketContext: MarketContext
  ): Promise<ConflictAnalysis> {
    // Run multiple conflict analyzers
    const analysisResults: ConflictResult[] = [];
    for (const analyzer of this.conflictAnalyzers) {
      const result = await analyzer.analyze(bullishStrategy, bearishStrategy, marketContext);
      analysisResults.push(result);
    }

    // Calculate overall conflict severity
    const severity = await this.severityCalculator.calculate(analysisResults);

    // Identify conflict patterns
    const patterns = await this.patternRecognizer.recognize(
      analysisResults,
      marketContext
    );

    // Generate conflict analysis
    return {
      conflicts: analysisResults,
      severity,
      patterns,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      marketContext
    };
  }
}

// Conflict analyzer interface
interface ConflictAnalyzer {
  analyze(
    bullish: TradingStrategy,
    bearish: TradingStrategy,
    context: MarketContext
  ): Promise<ConflictResult>;
}

// Specific conflict analyzer for signal direction
class SignalDirectionAnalyzer implements ConflictAnalyzer {
  async analyze(
    bullish: TradingStrategy,
    bearish: TradingStrategy,
    context: MarketContext
  ): Promise<ConflictResult> {
    const bullishSignal = bullish.direction;
    const bearishSignal = bearish.direction;

    const isConflict = this.isDirectionConflict(bullishSignal, bearishSignal);
    const severity = isConflict ? this.calculateSeverity(bullish, bearish) : 0;

    return {
      type: 'signal_direction',
      isConflict,
      severity,
      details: {
        bullishSignal,
        bearishSignal,
        timeframeMismatch: this.hasTimeframeMismatch(bullish, bearish)
      },
      confidence: this.calculateConfidence(bullish, bearish)
    };
  }
}
```

#### Conflict Severity Assessment
```typescript
// Severity calculation system
class SeverityCalculator {
  private weightConfig: SeverityWeights;

  async calculate(conflicts: ConflictResult[]): Promise<ConflictSeverity> {
    let totalScore = 0;
    let maxScore = 0;
    const contributingFactors: ConflictFactor[] = [];

    for (const conflict of conflicts) {
      if (conflict.isConflict) {
        const weight = this.weightConfig[conflict.type];
        const weightedScore = conflict.severity * weight;
        totalScore += weightedScore;
        maxScore += weight;

        contributingFactors.push({
          type: conflict.type,
          score: conflict.severity,
          weight,
          impact: weightedScore
        });
      }
    }

    const normalizedScore = maxScore > 0 ? totalScore / maxScore : 0;
    const severityLevel = this.categorizeSeverity(normalizedScore);

    return {
      score: normalizedScore,
      level: severityLevel,
      contributingFactors,
      recommendation: this.getRecommendation(severityLevel)
    };
  }

  private categorizeSeverity(score: number): ConflictLevel {
    if (score >= 0.8) return 'critical';
    if (score >= 0.6) return 'high';
    if (score >= 0.4) return 'medium';
    if (score >= 0.2) return 'low';
    return 'none';
  }
}

// Conflict severity structure
interface ConflictSeverity {
  score: number; // 0.0 - 1.0
  level: 'none' | 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  contributingFactors: ConflictFactor[];
  recommendation: string;
}
```

### Resolution Engine Implementation

#### Resolution Strategy Framework
```typescript
// Resolution engine with multiple strategies
class ConflictResolutionEngine {
  private strategies: ResolutionStrategy[];
  private strategySelector: StrategySelector;
  private performanceTracker: ResolutionPerformanceTracker;

  async resolveConflict(
    conflict: ConflictAnalysis,
    strategies: TradingStrategy[],
    marketContext: MarketContext
  ): Promise<ResolutionResult> {
    // Select best resolution strategy
    const selectedStrategy = await this.strategySelector.selectStrategy(
      conflict,
      marketContext
    );

    // Apply selected resolution strategy
    const resolution = await selectedStrategy.resolve(
      conflict,
      strategies,
      marketContext
    );

    // Track resolution performance
    await this.performanceTracker.trackResolution(
      conflict,
      resolution,
      selectedStrategy
    );

    return resolution;
  }
}

// Strategy selector based on context
class StrategySelector {
  private strategyPerformance: Map<string, PerformanceData>;

  async selectStrategy(
    conflict: ConflictAnalysis,
    context: MarketContext
  ): Promise<ResolutionStrategy> {
    // Get performance data for each strategy type
    const strategyScores = new Map<string, number>();

    for (const strategy of this.availableStrategies) {
      const performance = this.strategyPerformance.get(strategy.type) ||
        this.getDefaultPerformance();

      const contextScore = this.calculateContextFit(strategy, conflict, context);
      const overallScore = this.calculateOverallScore(performance, contextScore);

      strategyScores.set(strategy.type, overallScore);
    }

    // Select strategy with highest score
    const bestStrategyType = this.getBestStrategy(strategyScores);
    return this.getStrategyInstance(bestStrategyType);
  }
}
```

#### Specific Resolution Strategies

#### Confidence-Based Resolution
```typescript
// Confidence-based resolution strategy
class ConfidenceBasedResolution implements ResolutionStrategy {
  async resolve(
    conflict: ConflictAnalysis,
    strategies: TradingStrategy[],
    context: MarketContext
  ): Promise<ResolutionResult> {
    // Calculate confidence scores for each strategy
    const strategyConfidences = strategies.map(strategy => ({
      strategy,
      confidence: this.calculateOverallConfidence(strategy, conflict, context)
    }));

    // Sort by confidence
    strategyConfidences.sort((a, b) => b.confidence - a.confidence);

    const bestStrategy = strategyConfidences[0];
    const secondBest = strategyConfidences[1];

    // Check if there's a clear winner
    const confidenceGap = bestStrategy.confidence - secondBest.confidence;
    const isClearWinner = confidenceGap > this.confidenceThreshold;

    if (isClearWinner) {
      return {
        type: 'confidence_based',
        selectedStrategy: bestStrategy.strategy,
        confidence: bestStrategy.confidence,
        reasoning: `Selected strategy with highest confidence (${bestStrategy.confidence.toFixed(2)})`,
        alternative: secondBest.strategy,
        confidenceGap,
        isDefinitive: true
      };
    } else {
      // No clear winner, apply conservative resolution
      return this.applyConservativeResolution(strategyConfidences, conflict);
    }
  }

  private calculateOverallConfidence(
    strategy: TradingStrategy,
    conflict: ConflictAnalysis,
    context: MarketContext
  ): number {
    const baseConfidence = strategy.confidence || 0.5;
    const historicalPerformance = this.getHistoricalPerformance(strategy);
    const contextFit = this.calculateContextFit(strategy, context);
    const conflictRelevance = this.calculateConflictRelevance(strategy, conflict);

    // Weighted combination
    return (
      baseConfidence * 0.4 +
      historicalPerformance * 0.3 +
      contextFit * 0.2 +
      conflictRelevance * 0.1
    );
  }
}
```

#### Market Condition-Based Resolution
```typescript
// Market condition-based resolution
class MarketConditionResolution implements ResolutionStrategy {
  private marketRegimeAnalyzer: MarketRegimeAnalyzer;

  async resolve(
    conflict: ConflictAnalysis,
    strategies: TradingStrategy[],
    context: MarketContext
  ): Promise<ResolutionResult> {
    // Analyze current market regime
    const marketRegime = await this.marketRegimeAnalyzer.analyze(context);

    // Get regime-specific strategy preferences
    const regimePreferences = this.getRegimeStrategyPreferences(marketRegime);

    // Score each strategy based on regime fit
    const strategyScores = strategies.map(strategy => ({
      strategy,
      score: this.calculateRegimeFitScore(strategy, regimePreferences, marketRegime)
    }));

    // Select best strategy for current regime
    strategyScores.sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score);
    const bestStrategy = strategyScores[0];

    return {
      type: 'market_condition_based',
      selectedStrategy: bestStrategy.strategy,
      confidence: bestStrategy.score,
      reasoning: `Selected strategy best suited for ${marketRegime.type} market regime`,
      marketRegime,
      regimeFitScore: bestStrategy.score,
      alternative: strategyScores[1]?.strategy,
      isDefinitive: bestStrategy.score > this.minRegimeFitScore
    };
  }

  private calculateRegimeFitScore(
    strategy: TradingStrategy,
    preferences: RegimePreferences,
    regime: MarketRegime
  ): number {
    let score = 0;

    // Check strategy type compatibility
    if (preferences.preferredStrategyTypes.includes(strategy.type)) {
      score += 0.4;
    }

    // Check timeframe compatibility
    if (preferences.preferredTimeframes.includes(strategy.timeframe)) {
      score += 0.3;
    }

    // Check risk level compatibility
    const riskFit = this.calculateRiskFit(strategy.riskLevel, preferences.riskTolerance);
    score += riskFit * 0.3;

    return score;
  }
}
```

### Pattern Recognition System

#### Conflict Pattern Learning
```typescript
// Machine learning-based pattern recognition
class ConflictPatternRecognizer {
  private mlModel: PatternRecognitionModel;
  private patternDatabase: PatternDatabase;

  async recognize(
    conflicts: ConflictResult[],
    context: MarketContext
  ): Promise<ConflictPattern[]> {
    // Extract features from conflict analysis
    const features = this.extractFeatures(conflicts, context);

    // Use ML model to identify patterns
    const predictions = await this.mlModel.predict(features);

    // Match against known patterns
    const knownPatterns = await this.patternDatabase.findSimilarPatterns(features);

    // Combine ML predictions with known patterns
    const recognizedPatterns = this.combinePredictions(predictions, knownPatterns);

    return recognizedPatterns;
  }

  private extractFeatures(
    conflicts: ConflictResult[],
    context: MarketContext
  ): PatternFeatures {
    return {
      conflictTypes: conflicts.map(c => c.type),
      severityScores: conflicts.map(c => c.severity),
      marketVolatility: context.volatility,
      marketTrend: context.trend,
      timeframe: context.timeframe,
      assetType: context.assetType,
      agentTypes: this.extractAgentTypes(conflicts),
      historicalPatterns: this.getHistoricalPatternFeatures(conflicts)
    };
  }
}
```

## Notes

This task addresses a critical challenge in multi-agent trading systems: handling conflicts between different analytical approaches. The conflict resolution system must be sophisticated enough to handle complex trading scenarios while remaining practical for real-time use. The system should learn from experience and continuously improve its resolution capabilities. Special attention should be paid to maintaining decision quality while reducing the time and cognitive load required to resolve conflicts.
