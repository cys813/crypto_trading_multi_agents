# Task: News Source Adapter Framework and Connection Management

## Task Description
Design and implement a unified news source adapter framework that supports integration with multiple cryptocurrency news sources, including connection management, health monitoring, and failover mechanisms.

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Design
- **Adapter Pattern**: Implement unified adapter interface for all news sources
- **Connection Pool**: Manage multiple news source connections efficiently
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time health status monitoring for all news sources
- **Failover Mechanism**: Automatic failover when primary sources are unavailable

### Core Components
1. **Base Adapter Interface**: Abstract base class for all news source adapters
2. **Connection Manager**: Handle connection lifecycle and load balancing
3. **Health Monitor**: Monitor API response times and availability
4. **Rate Limiter**: Implement rate limiting for each news source API
5. **Error Handler**: Comprehensive error handling and retry logic

### Supported News Sources
- CoinDesk API adapter
- CoinTelegraph API adapter
- Decrypt API adapter
- CryptoSlate API adapter
- The Block API adapter

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must-Have Features
- [ ] Complete base adapter interface with standard methods (fetch_news, get_status, etc.)
- [ ] Implement at least 3 major news source adapters (CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, Decrypt)
- [ ] Connection manager supporting 10+ concurrent connections
- [ ] Health monitoring with 30-second check intervals
- [ ] Automatic failover mechanism with <1 minute detection time
- [ ] Rate limiting compliant with each news source API terms
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and logging
- [ ] Unit test coverage >85%

### Performance Requirements
- API response time <2 seconds for individual requests
- Connection establishment time <5 seconds
- Health check overhead <1% of system resources
- Support for 1000+ requests per minute
- Automatic recovery within 30 seconds of source failure

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Framework Design (2 days)
1. Design adapter interface and base classes
2. Define news data models and schemas
3. Create connection management architecture
4. Design health monitoring system

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (3 days)
1. Implement base adapter framework
2. Create connection manager with pool management
3. Build health monitoring system
4. Implement rate limiting and error handling

### Phase 3: Source Adapters (2 days)
1. Implement CoinDesk adapter
2. Implement CoinTelegraph adapter
3. Implement Decrypt adapter
4. Test adapter functionality and compliance

### Phase 4: Testing and Optimization (1 day)
1. Integration testing of all components
2. Performance testing and optimization
3. Error scenario testing
4. Documentation completion

## Deliverables

### Code Components
- `news_adapters/base_adapter.py` - Base adapter interface
- `news_adapters/connection_manager.py` - Connection management
- `news_adapters/health_monitor.py` - Health monitoring system
- `news_adapters/rate_limiter.py` - Rate limiting implementation
- `news_adapters/coindesk_adapter.py` - CoinDesk adapter
- `news_adapters/cointelegraph_adapter.py` - CoinTelegraph adapter
- `news_adapters/decrypt_adapter.py` - Decrypt adapter

### Documentation
- Adapter development guide
- API integration documentation
- Configuration management guide
- Health monitoring configuration

### Tests
- Unit tests for all adapters
- Integration tests for connection management
- Performance test reports
- Error scenario test cases

## Dependencies and Risks

### External Dependencies
- News source API access and documentation
- API key management and security
- Network connectivity and reliability

### Technical Risks
- API rate limits may restrict data collection
- News source API changes may break adapters
- Network connectivity issues may affect availability

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement robust error handling and retry logic
- Design for easy adapter updates and maintenance
- Build comprehensive monitoring and alerting

## Success Metrics
- 99.5% news source availability
- <1 minute failover time
- 100% API compliance
- <0.1% request failure rate
