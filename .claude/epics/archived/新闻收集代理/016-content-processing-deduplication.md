# Task: News Content Processing and Deduplication Pipeline

## Task Description
Implement comprehensive news content processing pipeline including content standardization, intelligent deduplication, noise filtering, and structural organization to ensure high-quality, unique news data.

## Technical Requirements

### Content Processing Pipeline
- **Content Standardization**: Normalize different content formats and structures
- **Intelligent Deduplication**: Advanced duplicate detection using content fingerprints and semantic analysis
- **Noise Filtering**: Remove irrelevant content, advertisements, and boilerplate text
- **Structural Organization**: Organize content into structured format for analysis
- **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate and score content quality

### Core Components
1. **Content Preprocessor**: Clean and standardize raw news content
2. **Deduplication Engine**: Detect and handle duplicate content across sources
3. **Noise Filter**: Remove irrelevant and low-quality content
4. **Content Structurer**: Convert content to structured format
5. **Quality Scorer**: Assess and score content quality

### Processing Algorithms
- Text similarity analysis for deduplication
- Content fingerprinting for duplicate detection
- Semantic analysis for content relevance
- Machine learning for quality assessment
- Natural language processing for content understanding

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must-Have Features
- [ ] Content standardization supporting multiple source formats
- [ ] Advanced deduplication with 95% accuracy
- [ ] Noise filtering removing 90% of irrelevant content
- [ ] Structured content output with consistent format
- [ ] Quality scoring system with 85% accuracy
- [ ] Processing pipeline handling 1000+ articles/minute
- [ ] Real-time processing capabilities
- [ ] Unit test coverage >85%

### Performance Requirements
- Processing time <1 second per article
- Deduplication accuracy >95%
- Memory usage <500MB for processing pipeline
- CPU usage <40% during peak processing
- Scalable to handle 10,000+ articles/day

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Pipeline Design (2 days)

3. Create deduplication strategies
4. Design quality assessment system

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (4 days)
1. Implement content preprocessor
2. Build deduplication engine with fingerprinting
3. Create noise filtering system
4. Implement content structurer
5. Build quality scoring system

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing (1 day)
1. Integrate with collection pipeline
2. Test processing performance and accuracy
3. Optimize algorithms and performance
4. Complete documentation and testing

## Deliverables
