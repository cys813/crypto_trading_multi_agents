class WeightedAverageFusion {
  private weightCalculator: DynamicWeightCalculator;
  private normalizer: SignalNormalizer;

  async fuseSignals(
    signals: TradingSignal[],
    context: FusionContext
  ): Promise<FusedSignal> {
    // Calculate dynamic weights based on performance
    const weights = await this.weightCalculator.calculateWeights(signals, context);

    // Normalize signals to common scale
    const normalizedSignals = await this.normalizer.normalize(signals);

    // Apply weighted fusion
    const fusedValue = this.calculateWeightedAverage(normalizedSignals, weights);

    // Calculate confidence and uncertainty
    const confidence = this.calculateConfidence(normalizedSignals, weights);
    const uncertainty = this.calculateUncertainty(normalizedSignals, weights);

    return {
      value: fusedValue,
      confidence,
      uncertainty,
      weights,
      algorithm: 'weighted_average',
      timestamp: new Date()
    };
  }

  private calculateWeightedAverage(
    signals: NormalizedSignal[],
    weights: Map<string, number>
  ): number {
    let weightedSum = 0;
    let totalWeight = 0;

    signals.forEach(signal => {
      const weight = weights.get(signal.source) || 0;
      weightedSum += signal.value * weight;
      totalWeight += weight;
    });

    return totalWeight > 0 ? weightedSum / totalWeight : 0;
  }
}
```

#### Bayesian Fusion Engine
```typescript
// Bayesian probability fusion
class BayesianFusionEngine {
  private priorModel: PriorModel;
  private likelihoodModel: LikelihoodModel;

  async fuseSignalsBayesian(
    signals: TradingSignal[],
    priorBelief: ProbabilityDistribution
  ): Promise<FusedSignal> {
    // Convert signals to probability distributions
    const signalDistributions = signals.map(signal =>
      this.convertToDistribution(signal)
    );

    // Apply Bayesian updating
    let posterior = priorBelief;
    for (const signalDist of signalDistributions) {
      posterior = this.updatePosterior(posterior, signalDist);
    }

    // Extract fused signal from posterior
    const fusedValue = posterior.getMean();
    const confidence = posterior.getConfidence();
    const uncertainty = posterior.getUncertainty();

    return {
      value: fusedValue,
      confidence,
      uncertainty,
      posterior,
      algorithm: 'bayesian',
      timestamp: new Date()
    };
  }

  private updatePosterior(
    prior: ProbabilityDistribution,
    likelihood: ProbabilityDistribution
  ): ProbabilityDistribution {
    // Bayesian updating: P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
    const numerator = likelihood.multiply(prior);
    const evidence = likelihood.integrate();
    return numerator.normalize();
  }
}
```

  private featureExtractor: FeatureExtractor;
  private trainer: ModelTrainer;

  async fuseSignalsML(
    signals: TradingSignal[],
    context: FusionContext
  ): Promise<FusedSignal> {
    // Extract features from signals and context
    const features = await this.featureExtractor.extract(signals, context);

    // Get predictions from ensemble models
    const predictions = await this.ensembleModel.predict(features);

    // Aggregate predictions with model weights
    const fusedPrediction = this.aggregatePredictions(predictions);

    // Calculate confidence based on model agreement
    const confidence = this.calculateModelAgreement(predictions);
    const uncertainty = 1 - confidence;

    return {
      value: fusedPrediction.value,
      confidence,
      uncertainty,
      modelWeights: predictions.map(p => p.weight),
      algorithm: 'machine_learning',
      timestamp: new Date()
    };
  }

  private aggregatePredictions(predictions: ModelPrediction[]): number {
    let weightedSum = 0;
    let totalWeight = 0;

    predictions.forEach(pred => {
      weightedSum += pred.value * pred.weight;
      totalWeight += pred.weight;
    });

    return totalWeight > 0 ? weightedSum / totalWeight : 0;
  }
}
```

  async calculateWeights(
    signals: TradingSignal[],
    context: FusionContext
  ): Promise<Map<string, number>> {
    const weights = new Map<string, number>();

    // Get historical performance for each signal source
    const performances = await this.performanceTracker.getPerformance(
      signals.map(s => s.source)
    );

    // Detect current market regime
    const marketRegime = await this.marketRegimeDetector.detectRegime(
      context.marketData
    );

    // Calculate base weights from performance
    const baseWeights = this.calculateBaseWeights(performances);

    // Apply market regime adjustments
    const adjustedWeights = this.adjustForMarketRegime(baseWeights, marketRegime);

    // Apply volatility scaling
    const volatilityAdjusted = this.adjustForVolatility(
      adjustedWeights,
      context.volatility
    );

    // Normalize weights to sum to 1
    return this.normalizeWeights(volatilityAdjusted);
  }

  private calculateBaseWeights(
    performances: PerformanceData[]
  ): Map<string, number> {
    const weights = new Map<string, number>();

    // Use exponential decay for recent performance
    performances.forEach(perf => {
      const weight = this.calculatePerformanceScore(perf);
      weights.set(perf.source, weight);
    });

    return weights;
  }

  private calculatePerformanceScore(performance: PerformanceData): number {
    const sharpeRatio = performance.sharpeRatio || 0;
    const winRate = performance.winRate || 0;
    const profitFactor = performance.profitFactor || 0;
    const maxDrawdown = performance.maxDrawdown || 1;

    // Combine multiple metrics
    const score = (sharpeRatio * 0.3 + winRate * 0.4 + profitFactor * 0.3) /
                  (1 + maxDrawdown);

    return Math.max(0, Math.min(1, score));
  }
}
```

  private timeframeWeights: Map<string, number>;

  async fuseAcrossTimeframes(
    timeframeSignals: Map<string, TradingSignal[]>,
    targetTimeframe: string
  ): Promise<FusedSignal> {
    // Align signals to target timeframe
    const alignedSignals = await this.timeframAligner.align(
      timeframeSignals,
      targetTimeframe
    );

    // Apply timeframe-specific weights
    const weightedSignals = this.applyTimeframeWeights(alignedSignals);

    // Perform fusion within each timeframe

      weightedSum += fusion.value * weight * fusion.confidence;
      totalWeight += weight * fusion.confidence;
      totalConfidence += fusion.confidence * weight;
    });

    const fusedValue = totalWeight > 0 ? weightedSum / totalWeight : 0;
    const avgConfidence = totalWeight > 0 ? totalConfidence / totalWeight : 0;

    return {
      value: fusedValue,
      confidence: avgConfidence,
      uncertainty: 1 - avgConfidence,
      algorithm: 'multi_timeframe',

## Notes

This task represents the core intelligence of the trading decision agent. The fusion algorithms must be carefully designed to handle the complexity of real-world trading signals while maintaining performance and reliability. The system should be able to adapt to changing market conditions and continuously improve its fusion performance over time. Special attention should be paid to avoiding overfitting and ensuring the algorithms generalize well to unseen market conditions.
