## Parallel Work Streams Analysis

### Phase 1 - Foundation (Week 1-2)
- **Stream A**: 030-architecture-design (40 hours) - Critical path
- **Stream B**: Blocked until 030 completes

### Phase 2 - Core Development (Week 3-6)
- **Stream A**: 031-data-receiver (48 hours) - Data pipeline
- **Stream B**: 032-indicators-engine (64 hours) - Technical analysis
- **Stream C**: 034-llm-integration (48 hours) - AI integration
- **Stream D**: 037-configuration-manager (24 hours) - Configuration

### Phase 3 - Algorithm Development (Week 5-8)
- **Stream A**: 033-signal-recognition (56 hours) - Signal detection
- **Stream B**: 035-winrate-calculation (40 hours) - Win rate analysis
- **Stream C**: 038-monitoring-system (24 hours) - Monitoring

### Phase 4 - Integration & Output (Week 7-9)
- **Stream A**: 036-report-generator (32 hours) - Report generation
- **Stream B**: Continue monitoring system work

### Phase 5 - Testing & Deployment (Week 9-10)
- **Stream A**: 039-testing-optimization (40 hours) - Final testing

## Execution Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Launch Now)
1. **Start 030-architecture-design immediately** - This is the only ready task and blocks all other work
2. **Prepare development environment** for parallel work streams
3. **Set up project management tools** to track parallel progress

### Week 1-2 Priorities
- Focus exclusively on architecture design completion
- Prepare technical documentation and design patterns
- Establish development standards and practices

### Week 3-6 Parallel Launch Strategy
Once architecture is complete, launch 4 parallel work streams:
1. **Data Processing Stream**: 031-data-receiver + 032-indicators-engine
2. **AI Integration Stream**: 034-llm-integration + 037-configuration-manager
3. **Algorithm Development Stream**: 033-signal-recognition (starts after indicators engine)
4. **Support Systems Stream**: 038-monitoring-system (starts after configuration)

### Critical Path Analysis
- **Critical Path**: 030 → 031 → 033 → 035 → 036 → 039
- **Total Critical Path Duration**: ~280 hours (7 weeks)
- **Parallel Potential**: Up to 4 concurrent work streams in peak phases

### Risk Mitigation
- **Architecture bottleneck**: 030 blocks everything - allocate senior resources
- **Integration complexity**: 039 depends on all others - allow buffer time
- **LLM dependency**: 034 and 036 are dependent on external services - plan accordingly

## Next Steps

1. **Launch 030-architecture-design** with priority resources
2. **Prepare parallel work environments** for Week 3 launch
3. **Establish coordination mechanisms** for parallel teams
4. **Set up dependency tracking** to monitor block status
5. **Plan integration points** for combining parallel work streams
